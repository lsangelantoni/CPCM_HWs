# CPCM_HWs
Repository of codes to derive and analyze several heatwave metrics during historical and future periods. Codes have been developed for assessing the impact of convection-permitting resolution in the representation of heatwaves. They are designed for climate simulations performed in the CORDEX FPS Convection (Coppola et al., 2020)
